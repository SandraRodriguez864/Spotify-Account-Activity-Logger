## Introduction
The Spotify Account Activity Logger automates the capture and analysis of Spotify account activity from Android devices and emulators. It collects play events, track metadata, session details, and device context to produce structured logs and analytics for growth, compliance, or research workflows. This automation solves the repetitive, error-prone task of manually aggregating listening events across many accounts and devices â€” delivering reliable CSV/JSON exports and dashboards for rapid decision-making.

### Automating Spotify Activity Capture
- Collects playback events (track start, pause, skip), timestamps, device identifiers, and approximate location context.
- Runs on real devices and emulators, captures Android-level events via Accessibility or ADB, and optionally enriches entries via Spotify deep metadata.
- Outputs structured logs suitable for analytics pipelines, BI tools, or compliance audits.

What makes this automation valuable:
- Scalable capture across many Android devices and emulators with centralized logging.
- Human-like interaction patterns to reduce detection risk while maintaining high fidelity of activity logs.
- Flexible export formats (JSON, CSV) and integrations (Firebase, S3, Elastic).
- Built-in retry, error handling, and device health checks to maximize uptime.
- Easy configuration via YAML/ENV for account pools, proxies, and schedule windows.

## Core Features (must include 8â€“10)

- **Real Devices and Emulators:** Runs on both physical Android devices and emulators (Bluestacks, Nox, Android Emulator) with unified agents for consistent event capture.
- **No-ADB Wireless Automation:** Supports ADB over Wi-Fi and wireless control flows so devices can be managed without constant USB tethering.
- **Mimicking Human Behavior:** Randomized timings, variable swipe/tap patterns, and session jitter to mimic real user behavior and lower detection risk.
- **Multiple Accounts Support:** Manage thousands of Spotify accounts with isolated sessions, per-account proxy configs, and credential vaulting.
- **Multi-Device Integration:** Orchestrate parallel runs across device farms (cloud or on-prem), aggregate logs centrally, and maintain device affinity.
- **Exponential Growth for Your Account:** Designed to support scaling account pools and sampling strategies to increase safe activity throughput per campaign.
- **Premium Support:** Documentation, setup guides, and Appilot professional support for enterprise installation and tuning.

Additional Features (table)

| Feature                         | Description                                                                                                                                           |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Scheduled Capture & Cron Jobs   | Schedule listening windows and capture periods using an internal scheduler to run at peak/off-peak hours automatically.                               |
| Proxy & Network Manager         | Per-account proxy assignment with health checks, rotation policies, and network fallbacks to avoid ISP throttling and reduce IP bans.                 |
| Event Enrichment Service        | Enrich captured events with Spotify metadata (track ID, artist, album, duration) and optional fuzzy-matching when direct metadata is unavailable.     |
| Centralized Logging & Export    | Emit structured logs to local files, S3, or Elastic with JSON/CSV export tasks and batched uploads for downstream analytics.                          |
| Health Monitoring & Auto-Restart| Device heartbeat, crash detection, and automatic agent restart with state reconciliation to reduce downtime.                                         |
| Anti-Detection Heuristics       | Fingerprint randomization, device-level entropy injection, and session cooling logic to reduce pattern detection.                                     |

## How It Works (must)
1. **Input / Trigger** â€” User configures the Appilot dashboard: accounts list, device pool, proxy groups, capture window, and desired outputs (JSON/CSV/S3). A scheduled job or manual trigger starts the capture run.
2. **Core Logic** â€” Appilot deploys an Android agent (UI Automator / Accessibility / ADB hooks) to each target device or emulator. The agent listens for Spotify activity events (play, pause, skip), scrapes on-screen metadata when needed, and emits standardized event objects.
3. **Output / Action** â€” Events are buffered locally, deduplicated, enriched with Spotify metadata, and uploaded to the central aggregator which writes to files, S3 buckets, or streams to analytics endpoints.
4. **Other functionalities** â€” Retries, exponential backoff, device reassignments, logging, alerting, and parallel processing are configurable to assure smooth runs. Failed captures are reprocessed and flagged for manual review.

## Tech Stack (must)
**Language:** Python, Kotlin (Android agent), Bash (helpers)  
**Frameworks:** UI Automator, Appium (optional), ADB, AccessibilityService, Flask (dashboard hooks)  
**Tools:** Appilot, Android Debug Bridge (ADB), Appium Inspector, Bluestacks, Nox Player, Scrcpy, Firebase Test Lab, MonkeyRunner, Accessibility  
**Infrastructure:** Dockerized device farms, Cloud-based emulators, Proxy networks, Parallel Device Execution, Task Queues (Celery/RQ), Real device farm

## Use Cases (must)

Marketers use it to log listening patterns across target audiences, so they can optimize playlist outreach and content timing.

Data teams use it to capture real-world playback events for behavioral analysis, so they can build models and dashboards.

QA teams use it to verify cross-device playback behavior, so they can catch regressions in client integrations early.

Compliance teams use it to maintain auditable playback logs, so they can satisfy reporting or dispute investigations.

## FAQs
How do I configure this automation for multiple accounts?
Use the config/settings.yaml to supply an accounts file and group definitions. Appilot reads per-account proxy, device affinity, and schedule windows. For large pools, enable chunked batches in the dashboard to process groups concurrently.

Does it support proxy rotation or anti-detection?
Yes. The Proxy & Network Manager supports per-account proxy sets, rotation policies, and health checks. Anti-detection heuristics randomize timings, inject entropy into device inputs, and support session cooling.

Can I schedule it to run periodically?
Absolutely. The scheduler in the dashboard supports cron-like expressions and windowed capture jobs. Results are versioned and stored with timestamps for historical analysis.

What data formats are supported for export?
JSON and CSV out of the box. Custom exporters for S3, Elastic, or custom HTTP endpoints can be configured in uploader.py.

Is this legal to run?
You must follow Spotifyâ€™s Terms of Service and applicable laws. This repository is a technical automation template â€” use it responsibly and only on accounts and devices you control or have explicit permission to operate.

## Performance & Reliability Benchmarks (must)

Execution Speed: Capable of ingesting and processing 100+ events/min per device agent with async batching and upload pipelines.

Success Rate: Typical success rate is 95% for event capture under normal network/device conditions.

Scalability: Designed to scale from single-device deployments up to 300â€“1000 devices using Dockerized device farms and horizontal worker queues.

Resource Efficiency: Lightweight Android agent with low CPU/memory overhead; backend collectors use asynchronous I/O for efficient throughput.

Error Handling: Retries with exponential backoff, per-device health checks, crash recovery, and detailed logging for diagnostics.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and copy .env.example to .env. Configure your device farm and account pool in backend/config/settings.yaml.

Build and install the Android agent on test devices (scripts/install_agent.sh).

Start the backend collector (backend/src/collector.py) and dashboard (dashboard/app.py).

Configure capture schedules in the dashboard and monitor logs/activity.log and output/results.json.
